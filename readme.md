# Neuroscience research

Before exploring machine learning, we should first take a look at some neuroscience fundementals. This will help contextualise the
artificial neural networks (ANNs) we'll be studying later.


## Introduction

What exactly is neuroscience? Well, neuroscience is a more recent term for orignally seperate fields such as neurochemistry,
neuroanatomy and neuropsychology. Neuroscience tries to unify these feilds, creating a common knowledge base and common goal -
to understanding nervous systems.

Neurons and gila are the fundemental building blocks of a nervous system. Neurons are specialised cells that can receive and
transmit electrochemical signals, forming neural networks. There are many different classifications of neuron which we will
describe a little later. A typical neuron is shown in below:

* **Nucleus**: as in other cell types, the nucleus contains genetic information neccessary for the production of proteins in the
  cell.
  
* **Axon (nerve fibre)**: slender projections away from the main cell body, conductive to electrical impulses (action potentials). 
  They are used to transport signals between neurons and recievers such as other neurons, muscles or glands.
  
* **Axon terminal**: the end of an axon, separated from postsynaptic receptors by the synapse gap.

* **Dendrite**: branched extensions of a neuron which transfer electrochemical impulses received from other neural cells to the
  cell body. Dendritic structures are key to how the various inputs recieved by a neuron effect it's output.

* **Myelin sheath**: used to increase the efficiency of electrical transmission in axons.


## Neuron types

Neurons can be classified according to their locaiton, shape, operative function etc. Motor neurons for example are used to send
impulses to biological actuators like muscles and glands and organs. In contrast, sensory neurons are used to receive input from
the outside word, being activated chemically or physically.

Now, when it comes to neurons in the brain, classification is a little less clear cut.
