# Neuroscience research

Before exploring machine learning, we should first take a look at some neuroscience fundementals. This will help contextualise the
artificial neural networks (ANNs) we'll be studying later.


## Introduction

What exactly is neuroscience? Well, neuroscience is a more recent term for orignally seperate fields such as neurochemistry,
neuroanatomy and neuropsychology. Neuroscience tries to unify these feilds, creating a common knowledge base and common goal -
to understanding nervous systems.

Neurons and gila are the fundemental building blocks of a nervous system. Neurons are specialised cells that can receive and
transmit electrochemical signals, forming neural networks. There are many different classifications of neuron which we will
describe a little later. A typical neuron is shown in below:
