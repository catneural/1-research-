# Neural circuits

So we understand that there are motoneurons, sensory neurons and interneurons, but how can what are
essentially just input, output and relay devices do anything useful or "smart"? Well, this is where
neural circuits enter the picture.


## Fundementals

There are a few important topics we should understand first, before discussing neural circuits.


### Action potentials
