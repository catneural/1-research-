# Neural circuits

So we understand that there are motoneurons, sensory neurons and interneurons, but how can what are
essentially just input, output and relay devices do anything useful or "smart"? Well, this is where
neural circuits enter the picture.


## Potentials

* Action potential - the mechinism by which signals are propagated along a neuron's axons
* Membrane potential - the difference in electric potential between the interiour and exteriour of a cell
* Synaptic potential - the incomming (recieved) signal resulting from the action of neurotransmitters at the synapse
* Excitatory postsynaptic potential - makes a neuron more likely to fire at a particular instant
* Inhibitory postsynaptic potential - makes a neuron less likely to fire at a particular instant
* Action threshhold - the threshhold needed for a neuron to fire. A neuron fires depending on whether the sum of exitatory and inhibitory
  postsynaptic potentials reaches the threshhold


## Synaptic Plasticity

Synaptic plasticity is the ability for synapses to strengthen or weaken over time in response to their
activity. This can occur through several mechanisms, e.g. changes in neurotransmitter quantity or the number of neurotransmitter
receptors.
