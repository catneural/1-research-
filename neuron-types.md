# Neuron types

Visually neurons may appear almost identical, however they are actually heterogenous in both shape and function.


### Motor neurons

Motor neurons form connections with movable parts of an organism, e.g. glands and muscles. Motor neurons have an
interesting relationship with sensory neurons. In some very simple organisms like sponges, motor neurons aren't needed
because sensors act directly on effector cells. Slightly more complex creatures like cnidarians have a two layered
system - sensory neurons recieve input and send information down their axons to motor neurons, which in turn call upon
effector cells.
