# Neuron types

Visually neurons may appear almost identical, however they are actually heterogenous in both shape and function.


## Sensory neurons

These neurons are triggered by environmental stimuli, e.g. chemical substances, temperature, light, vibration etc.


## Motor neurons (motoneurons)

Motor neurons form connections with movable parts of an organism, e.g. glands and muscles. Motor neurons have an
interesting relationship with sensory neurons. In some very simple organisms like sponges, motor neurons aren't needed
because sensors act directly on effector cells. Slightly more complex creatures like cnidarians have a two layered
system - sensory neurons recieve input and send information down their axons to motor neurons, which in turn call upon
effector cells. This flow of information from sensory neuron to motoneuron to effector cell has been defined as the 
"simple reflex."

### Motoneuron to motoneuron

Even is simple creatures like the Hydra, an interesting example of adjacent communication can be observed between
motoneurons. Essentially, while motoneurons usually have axons to innovate a population of effector cells, in some
cases they in fact have connections between themselves. 


## Interneurons

Interneurons are essentially connectors between brain regions. Local interneurons have short axons and connect to
other neurons nearby, forming local neural circuits. Relay interneurons have long axons and connect desparete brain
regions together.
